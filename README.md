# Simple Super Malloc

## Description
This project are aimed to create demo with source code for the most popular solutions of memory management.  
Such as:  
TCMalloc  
JEMalloc  
TBBMalloc  
McRTMalloc  
FreeRTOS Malloc  
TLSF Malloc  
SuperMalloc  

We also want to verify the performance with different machanism, and add optional memory shrunk functionality to each of them.  

## FreeRTOS Malloc
source code:  
```
esm_freertos_malloc.hpp
esm_freertos_malloc.cpp
```  
[Documentation](https://github.com/embeddedartistry/libmemory/blob/master/README.md)  
This solution is the easiest way for malloc and free.
